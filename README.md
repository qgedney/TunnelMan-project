Player must dig underground tunnels through an oil field looking for oil. After the player has gathered all available oil within a particular field, the level is completed and the player advances to a new,
more difficult oil field. The player must also avoid protesters and boulders in his search, and he is aided in his effort by several "goodies" they can find while digging through the oil field.
Developed a video game in C++, using inheritance, polymorphism, priority queues/heaps, and various search algorithms.
